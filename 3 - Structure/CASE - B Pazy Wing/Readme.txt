This folder is oranised as follow,
    01_Modal_undeformed/ contains the modal analysis of UM/NAST and ASWING against experimental measurements
                         for the underformed case (the Pazy wing is anchored vertically). The comparison are 
                         summed up in a excel in a subfolder named 00_Comparisons.

    
    02_Modal_Gravity/  contains the modal analysis of UM/NAST and ASWING against experimental measurements
                       for the deformed case (the Pazy wing is anchored horrizontally). The comparison are 
                       summed up in a excel in a subfolder named 00_Comparisons.

    03_Static_Structural/ contains the tip displacement en twist analysis of UM/NAST and ASWING against 
                          experimental measurements

    Pazy_properties/    contains the Pazy structural properties digitalized based on screenshots of interest 
                        of the below references.
